          This is an atom.
        </div>
        <p>An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that constitutes a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers (1/10000000000 of a centimeter) across. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics—as if they were billiard balls, for example, is not possible due to quantum effects. Current atomic models use quantum principles to better explain and predict this behavior. Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons. Only the most common variety of hydrogen has no neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively. These atoms are called ions.</p>
        
        <h1 id="part1">History of the <b>ATOM</b></h1>
        <h2>My Essay</h2>
        <p>The history of the atom begins around 450 B.C. with a Greek philosopher named Democritus. Democritus wondered what would happen if you cut a piece of matter, such as an apple, into smaller and smaller pieces. He thought that a point would be reached where matter could not be cut into still smaller pieces. He called these "uncuttable" pieces "atomos", in Greek. This is where the modern term atom comes from.</p>
        <p>Democritus was an important philosopher. However, he was less influential than the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived about 100 years after Democritus. Aristotle rejected Democritus’s idea of atoms. In fact, Aristotle thought the idea of atoms was ridiculous. Unfortunately, Aristotle’s ideas were accepted for more than 2000 years. During that time, Democritus’s ideas were more or less forgotten.</p>
        <p>Around 1800, a British chemist named John Dalton revived Democritus’s early ideas about the atom. Dalton is pictured in Figure below. He made a living by teaching and just did research in his spare time. Nonetheless, from his research results, he developed one of the most important theories in science.</p>
        <p>Dalton did many experiments that provided evidence for atoms. For example, he studied the pressure of gases. He concluded that gases must consist of tiny particles in constant motion. Dalton also researched the properties of compounds. He showed that a compound always consists of the same elements in the same ratio. On the other hand, different compounds always consist of different elements or ratios. This can happen, Dalton reasoned, only if elements are made of tiny particles that can combine in an endless variety of ways. From his research, Dalton developed a theory of the atom.</p>
        <p>The atomic theory Dalton developed consists of three ideas:

All substances are made of atoms. Atoms are the smallest particles of matter. They cannot be divided into smaller particles. They also cannot be created or destroyed.
All atoms of the same element are alike and have the same mass. Atoms of different elements are different and have different masses.
Atoms join together to form compounds. A given compound always consists of the same kinds of atoms in the same ratio.
Dalton’s theory was soon widely accepted. Most of it is still accepted today. The only part that is no longer accepted is his idea that atoms are the smallest particles. Scientists now know that atoms consist of even smaller particles.</p>
